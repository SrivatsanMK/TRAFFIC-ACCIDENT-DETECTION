Accurate and timely detection of road accidents is crucial for enhancing road safety and minimizing potential hazards. In this project, we present an advanced Accident 
Detection Model based on a state-of-the-art real-time object detection framework. Our model utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze road surveillance videos, identify 
potential accidents, and provide proactive insights for risk mitigation. The predictive component of the system utilizes a machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of
historical accident data, considering factors like as road geometry. The model learns to recognize patterns and correlations between these factors and the occurrence of 
accidents. As a result, it can predict the probability of an accident happening in real-time based on the ongoing video feed.The user interface provides a straightforward and 
intuitive platform for users to upload road CCTV videos and receive instantaneous feedback regarding the likelihood of an accident. The system gives the output of the video by 
input video as either accident occurs or not with a corresponding confidence score. Users can thus take proactive measures to mitigate potential risks and enhance overall road 
safety.The proposed Intelligent Accident Prediction System aims to contribute to the reduction of road accidents by providing a proactive and data-driven approach to 
identifying potential risk factors. By integrating cutting-edge computer vision technologies, this system represents a step towards the development of smarter, safer, and 
more efficient transportation systems. The project concludes with the deployment of the trained model for accident detection on external videos. Users can input video, and the 
model processes and identifies potential accidents.
